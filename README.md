# Project2

I was unable to get most of my code to work, as I had a very difficult time avoiding/changing the firewall rules in addition to having difficulties with incorporating everything into the cloud. Azure Data Studio was giving me troubles in addition to Azure Databricks, so it was very difficult to make all of the necessary connections unfortunately.

However, I was able to create my database and create new tables as I desired, which I included as SQL and JSON files within this repo.
I understand my Databricks file does not really have functionality, but I have most of the code that would allow for me to complete the project if such connections were able to be made.
